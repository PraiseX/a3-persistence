Assignment 3 - Persistence: Two-tier Web Application with Database, Express server, and CSS template


## Movie Watchlist

your glitch (or alternative server) link e.g. https://a3-praisex.glitch.me/


- this website loads a simple movie watchlist that allows for you to log and keep track of movies
- challenges I faced were trying to understand how the server and the client interact, as well as how to implement cookies. I don't know if I just didn't put forward enough effort, but I couldn't get either to work
- The authentication strategy I tried to use was checking if the entered username and password matched with a username and password in the database, I chose this method because it seemed the easiest 
- I tried to use the bootstrap framwork because it was the easiest to implement and is used by plenty of companies. I did not include any modifications to the framwork
- middleware packages used:
-   body-parser
-   cookie-session
-   custom middleware that is supposed to always sends unauthenicaetd users to the login page
